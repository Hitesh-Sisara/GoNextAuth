## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.18 or higher.
- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher (with `npm` or `bun`).
- **PostgreSQL**: A running instance. Using Docker is recommended for ease of setup.
- **AWS SES Credentials**: For sending transactional emails.
- **Google OAuth Credentials**: For Google Sign-In.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hitesh-Sisara/GoNextAuth.git
cd GoNextAuth
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Go)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd go-backend
    ```

2.  **Configure your environment.** Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it out with your credentials. The file is commented to guide you on what's required (database connection, JWT secret, email provider, and Google credentials).

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    go run cmd/server/main.go
    ```

The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html`.

### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ../nextjs-frontend
    ```

2.  **Configure your environment.** Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your Google Client ID and API URL.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    bun install
    # or npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    bun dev
    # or npm run dev
    ```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üîí Security

Security is a top priority for this project. Here are some of the key security features implemented:

- **HTTPS in Production:** Assumed and configured via cookies (`secure: true`).
- **Password Policy:** Enforces strong passwords on the frontend and backend.
- **HTTP Security Headers:** Middleware adds `CSP`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, etc., to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Secure Token Storage:** Securely stores JWTs using cookies and localStorage.
- **Google OAuth `state` Parameter:** Used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks during the OAuth flow.
- **Input Sanitization & Validation:** All user input is validated and sanitized.
